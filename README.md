This Python script uses Selenium WebDriver to test the login, profile verification, and logout process on the DemoQA website.

It works like this:

1-Opens Chrome and goes to the login page.
2-Types the username and password into the login form.
3-Clicks the login button and waits for the page to load.
4-Checks the profile page to make sure the username matches what we expect.
5-Logs out from the account.
